## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how backgroud-image property works to add images to the background of an element. Initially, I tried to use <img> tags to show the bg pattern images.

```css
.body {
  background-image: url("images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
    url("images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
}
```

### Continued development

I don't think I got the background right and I'm still not familiar with all css background properties.
